I manage my dotfiles with a bare git repository.
Motivation came from [this Hacker News Post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797) and
[this blog post](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).
See the blog post above for a tutorial on how to set-up, manage, and import dotfiles using this workflow.

Most of my configs come from [brokenbyte's dotfile repo](https://gitlab.com/brokenbyte/dotfiles).
