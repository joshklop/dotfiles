# Todo

* [ ] Really understand how nix works
* [ ] Make `fzf` ignore certain directories (e.g. Zotero, node\_modules, etc.)
* [ ] Rice rofi
* [ ] Switch from i3 to xmonad (haskell all the things!)
* [ ] `Xresources`
* zinit
  + [ ] see brokenbyte's configs
  + [ ] prompt for git fanciness
  + [ ] completions, plus you want to use compinit in turbo mode (no `autoload -Uz compinit; compinit`)
* neovim
  + [ ] better ui for nvim-dap
  + [ ] use new diagnostic features
  + [ ] use buf-local settings (e.g. declutter your keymaps)
  + [ ] lualine
  + [ ] Organize directories (i.e. use ftdetect, ftplugin, colors, etc.)
  + [ ] Set up code action keymaps nvim-lsp
  + [ ] Use lsp plugins instead of lspconfig where possible
  + [ ] Look into using treesitter to do cool things with latex
