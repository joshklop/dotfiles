# Todo

* [ ] Make `fzf` ignore certain directories (e.g. Zotero, node\_modules, etc.)
* [ ] Make `paru` ignore certain packages, especially manually installed ones (i.e. f5)
* [ ] Rice `rofi` and learn to use ssh helper
* [ ] Switch from i3 to xmonad (haskell all the things!)
* Neovim
  + [ ] `Xresources`
  + [ ] Packer.nvim: take advantage of `use` functions to configure plugins and do other things
  + [ ] Set up code action keymaps nvim-lsp
  + [ ] Organize directories (i.e. use ftdetect, ftplugin, colors, etc.)
  + [ ] Look into using treesitter to do cool things with latex

# Done

* [X] Set up `nvim-jdtls`+`nvim-dap` for Java
* [X] `nvim-dap`: fix signs
* [X] `nvim-jdtls`: fix :JdtJshell command (didn't need fixing: it will only work in .java buffers)
* [X] Telescope.nvim: use fzf instead of native searching
* [X] Use light theme supported by treesitter (or make one)
* [X] Fix dunst CTRL-space keymaps
